truffle-used in compile and deploy.


1. truffle init    --   initilaization of project 
it made three folder contracts  --- used for storing contracts.

migrations---used in deployment

test --- used in testing


truffle-config.js  ---- used for configuration


write truffle compile to compile all contarcts in the contracts folder and made a build folder where there are json files.

now these json contains abi and bytecode.

DEPLOYMENT--
now for deployments made custom file by copying all data of the sample file and name change in the migrations folder.

the number in the migration filenames specify the order of deployment now change in config line 47

for deployment-----  truffle migrate (it also compiles)

but now if we channge the file and again type truffle migrate it does not deploy again

for this problem type truffle migrate --reset
